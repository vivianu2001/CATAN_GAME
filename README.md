# Catan Game üé≤üõ§Ô∏è

This project is an implementation of a simplified version of the Settlers of Catan board game for three players. The game includes basic rules for resource gathering, trading, building roads, settlements, cities, and using development cards. This README file provides details about the rules, class hierarchy, libraries used, and methods implemented.

## Game Rules

### Basic Rules

- **Players**: The game is designed for three players.
- **Setup**:
  - Each player starts with 2 settlements and 2 roads.
  - Players receive starting resources based on their initial settlements.
- **Turn Structure**:
  - Roll two six-sided dice to determine resource distribution.
  - Players can trade, build, and use development cards during their turn.
  - Each action (except using the Year of Plenty card) ends the player's turn.
- **Victory Points**:
  - Players earn points for building settlements and cities, and for holding certain development cards.
  - The first player to reach 10 victory points wins the game.

### Actions

- **Trade**: Players can trade resources and development cards with other players.
- **Build Road**: Players can build roads on specified edges of the board.
- **Build Settlement**: Players can build settlements on specified vertices of the board.
- **Build City**: Players can upgrade settlements to cities on specified vertices.
- **Buy Development Card**: Players can purchase development cards using resources.
- **Use Development Card**: Players can use development cards they have acquired.
- **End Turn**: Players can end their turn.

### Resources and Construction

#### Development Card
- **Cost**: 1 Iron, 1 Wool, 1 Oat
- **Types**:
  - **Promotion Card**: Grants a temporary benefit and then is discarded. Types include:
    - **Monopoly**: The player chooses one resource type, and all other players must give all their resources of that type to the player.
    - **Road Building**: The player can build 2 roads for free.
    - **Year of Plenty**: The player receives two resource cards of their choice from the bank.
  - **Knights**: A player with 3 Knight cards receives the Largest Army card, worth 2 victory points. (There are only 3 Knight cards in total).
  - **Victory Point Cards**: Each card gives the player 1 victory point. There are 4 such cards.

#### Construction
- **Road Section**:
  - **Cost**: 1 Brick, 1 Wood
  - **Conditions**: Can only be connected to a settlement (or city) owned by the player or to another road section.
- **Settlement**:
  - **Cost**: 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wool, 1 Oat
  - **Conditions**: Can be built on an intersection connected by at least one road and at least two road segments away from another settlement. Each settlement gives 1 victory point.
- **City**:
  - **Cost**: 3 Iron, 2 Oats
  - **Conditions**: Can replace an existing settlement. Each city gives 2 victory points and generates double the resources of a settlement.

### Progress of the Game

Each player starts the game with 2 settlements and 2 road segments, which give them 2 victory points. Players receive starting resources based on their initial settlements (one resource from each type). The order of play is determined arbitrarily.

In each turn, players roll two dice. Depending on the result, players receive resources as described earlier. During their turn, a player can:

1. Trade resources or development cards with other players.
2. Build roads, settlements, or cities and buy development cards.
3. Use development cards (if the player uses a development card, their turn ends immediately).

If the dice roll totals 7, all players with more than 7 resource cards must return half of them to the resource pile.

### Game Over

The game ends when a player reaches 10 or more victory points. The player must have at least 10 points at the end of their turn to win the game.

## Class Hierarchy

- **Board**: Manages the game board, resource distribution, and player settlements/roads.
- **Player**: Represents a player in the game, managing resources, development cards, and actions.
- **DevelopmentCard**: Abstract base class for development cards.
  - **KnightCard**: Derived class representing the Knight card.
  - **VictoryPointCard**: Derived class representing the Victory Point card.
  - **PromotionCard**: Derived class representing promotion cards (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty).
- **TradeManager**: Handles trading of resources and development cards between players.
- **Enums**: Defines enums for resource types and development card types.

## Libraries Used

- Standard Library (`iostream`, `vector`, `string`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`)
- Custom header files (`Player.hpp`, `Board.hpp`, `DevelopmentCard.hpp`, `TradeManager.hpp`, `Enums.hpp`)

## Methods Implemented

### Board Class
- **initializePlayerSettlementsAndRoads**: Places initial settlements and roads for players.
- **distributeResources**: Distributes resources to players based on dice roll and board state.
- **buildRoad**: Allows a player to build a road on a specified edge.
- **buildSettlement**: Allows a player to build a settlement on a specified vertex.
- **buildCity**: Allows a player to upgrade a settlement to a city on a specified vertex.

### Player Class

- **getName**: Returns the player's name.
- **getPlayerId**: Returns the player's ID.
- **getVictoryPoints**: Returns the player's current victory points.
- **getResourceCount**: Returns the count of a specific resource the player has.
- **addResource**: Adds a specified amount of a resource to the player's inventory.
- **addDevelopmentCard**: Adds a development card to the player's inventory.
- **useDevelopmentCard**: Uses a development card from the player's inventory and returns its type.
- **buildRoad**: Adds a road to the player's list of roads.
- **buildSettlement**: Adds a settlement to the player's list of settlements.
- **buildCity**: Upgrades a settlement to a city.
- **buyDevelopmentCard**: Buys a development card for the player.
- **printStatus**: Prints the player's current status (resources, victory points, etc.).

### DevelopmentCard Class

- **useCard**: Pure virtual function to be overridden by derived classes to define card usage.
- **getType**: Pure virtual function to be overridden by derived classes to return the card type.

### Derived Development Card Classes

- **KnightCard::useCard**: Implements usage for the Knight card.
- **VictoryPointCard::useCard**: Implements usage for the Victory Point card.
- **PromotionCard::useCard**: Implements usage for promotion cards (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty).
- **PromotionCard::getTypeP**: Returns the specific type of promotion card.

### TradeManager Class

- **tradeResources**: Facilitates trading resources between players.
- **tradeDevelopmentCards**: Facilitates trading development cards between players.
- **verifyTradeResources**: Verifies if a resource trade can be made.
- **verifyTradeDevelopmentCards**: Verifies if a development card trade can be made.

### Main Game Loop

- Initializes the board and players.
- Manages the turn structure, player actions, and victory condition.
- Implements the logic for trading, building, and using development cards.
- Ends the game when a player reaches 10 victory points.
